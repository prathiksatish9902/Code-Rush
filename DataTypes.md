# Data Types

Represents the data of which type.


## Different data types
#### pre defined data types
-int(integer) size = 4 bytes
-float (decimal point) size = 4 bytes
-char (character or strings) size= 1 bytes for character 
for strings size has to be mentioned
-double (used fordecimal points) size =8 bytes

#### derived data types
-arrays
-pointers
-structures (we can use different pre defined data types inside the structure)
it is also called user defined data types.

## key points
for 12.5 the compiler consider the data type as double
if we give 12.5f the compiler consider as float.

for pointers it allocates 8 bytes of memory.
